## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

setwd("/Users/tejaswinamana/Downloads/practice")

#Read data file
```{r}

flight <- read.csv(file = "FlightDelays.csv", header = T, sep = ",")

```


```{r}

str(flight)

summary(flight)

```

#Data Preprocessing

#Check for missing value
```{r}

sum(is.na(flight))

```

#Convert the attributes to appropriate type
```{r}

flight$Weather <- as.factor(flight$Weather)

flight$DAY_WEEK <- as.factor(flight$DAY_WEEK)

flight$Flight.Status <- ifelse(flight$Flight.Status == 0,"on-time", "delayed")

flight$Flight.Status <- as.factor(flight$Flight.Status)

```


#categorize departure time into bins based on your client needs
```{r}



flight$levels <- ifelse(flight$DEP_TIME>=600 & flight$DEP_TIME<1200, "level1",
                      ifelse(flight$DEP_TIME>=1200 & flight$DEP_TIME<1800, "level2",
                             ifelse(flight$DEP_TIME>=1800 & flight$DEP_TIME<=2100, "level3", "level4")))


flight$levels <- as.factor(flight$levels)

str(flight)
```

#The DEP_TIME column can now be dropped
```{r}

flight <- flight[,!colnames(flight) %in% c("DEP_TIME")]
```

#Train - Test split
```{r}

library(caret)

train_rows <- createDataPartition(y = flight$Flight.Status, p = 0.7, list = F)

train <- flight[train_rows,]

test <- flight[-train_rows]

```

#Build the Naive Bayes classifier
```{r}

library(e1071)

model_nb <- naiveBayes(train$Flight.Status~., train)

print(model_nb)

```
